        String[] input = new String[]{"A-","A","A-","B+","A","C-","D","B+","B-","A","F","A+","C+","F","D-","F","B+","A"};
        //Step 1: Remove duplicates and print the result
        
		//System.out.println(result of step 1);
        //Expected output: "A-","A","B+","C-","D","B-","F","A+","C+","D-"
        
        //Step 2: Sort the array (after duplicates are removed) in U.S. letter-grade order and print the result. 
		//It is in order of the letters, and also in order from + to -. 
		//For example, A+, A, A-, B+,B,B-,C+,C,C-, D+,D,D-,F+,F,F-
        
		//System.out.println(result of step 2);
        //Expected output: "A+","A","A-","B+","B-","C+","C-","D","D-","F"
    }
